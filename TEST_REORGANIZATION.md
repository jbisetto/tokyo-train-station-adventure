# Test Reorganization Summary

This document describes the test reorganization for the Tokyo Train Station Adventure project.

## Reorganization Goals

1. Consolidate all tests into a single `tests/` directory structure
2. Maintain existing organization by module/component
3. Add clear README files explaining the test structure
4. Provide easy-to-use scripts for running tests

## Changes Made

1. Created integration test directories in the main tests folder:
   - `tests/backend/integration/tier2/` - For Ollama/DeepSeek-R1 tests
   - `tests/backend/integration/tier3/` - For AWS Bedrock tests

2. Moved tests from multiple locations to the consolidated structure:
   - Moved `backend/tests/integration/tier2/*` to `tests/backend/integration/tier2/`
   - Moved root level test files (`test_ollama_*.py`) to `tests/backend/integration/tier2/`
   - Moved `test_bedrock.py` to `tests/backend/integration/tier3/`

3. Updated test run scripts:
   - Updated `run_tests.sh` in `tests/backend/integration/tier2/` to work from the new location
   - Created a master `run_all_tests.sh` script in the `tests/` directory

4. Added detailed README files:
   - Updated the main `tests/README.md` with overall test structure
   - Added `tests/backend/integration/tier2/README.md` for Tier2 integration tests
   - Added `tests/backend/integration/tier3/README.md` for Tier3 integration tests

5. Updated the main project README with the new test organization information

## New Test Structure

```

## Running Tests

The organization maintains backward compatibility while providing new, more convenient ways to run tests:

1. The main test runner: `tests/run_all_tests.sh`
2. Individual test categories can still be run using `pytest`
3. Individual integration test suites can be run from their respective directories

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. All tests are in one location, making them easier to find and run
2. Clear organization by module, tier, and test type
3. Detailed documentation on how to run tests
4. Separation of unit tests from integration tests
5. Support for both automated test runs and individual test execution
