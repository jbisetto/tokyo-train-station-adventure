# Template System Implementation

## Overview

The Template System is a fundamental component of the Tokyo Train Station Adventure's companion AI, providing a structured approach to generating responses for common player requests. This system enables the AI to deliver consistent, contextually appropriate, and linguistically accurate responses while minimizing computational overhead for straightforward interactions.

## Architecture

The Template System consists of the following components:

1. **TemplateManager Class**: The central component responsible for:
   - Loading and organizing templates
   - Selecting appropriate templates based on context
   - Managing template versioning
   - Providing access to templates for other components

2. **TemplateRepository**: Responsible for:
   - Storing templates in an organized structure
   - Categorizing templates by intent, complexity, and scenario
   - Providing efficient template retrieval
   - Supporting template updates and additions

3. **TemplateEngine**: Handles:
   - Template variable substitution
   - Conditional template logic
   - Template composition and nesting
   - Dynamic content generation within templates

4. **TemplateValidator**: Ensures:
   - Syntactic correctness of templates
   - Consistency in variable usage
   - Adherence to style guidelines
   - Linguistic accuracy in both English and Japanese

## Implementation Details

### Template Structure

Templates are structured using a flexible format that supports:

1. **Variable Placeholders**: Markers for dynamic content insertion
2. **Conditional Sections**: Parts of the template that are included based on conditions
3. **Nested Templates**: References to other templates that can be included
4. **Metadata**: Information about the template's purpose, usage, and requirements

Example template structure:
```
{
  "id": "ticket_purchase_confirmation",
  "intent": "GENERAL_HINT",
  "scenario": "TICKET_PURCHASE",
  "complexity": "SIMPLE",
  "english": "I can help you buy a ticket to {{destination}}. The fare is {{fare}} yen. Would you like me to guide you through the process?",
  "japanese": "{{destination}}行きの切符を買うお手伝いができます。運賃は{{fare}}円です。買い方をご案内しましょうか？",
  "variables": ["destination", "fare"],
  "conditions": {
    "has_ic_card": {
      "true": "You can also use your IC card for this journey.",
      "false": ""
    }
  }
}
```

### Template Selection

Templates are selected based on multiple factors:

1. **Intent Matching**: Selecting templates that match the classified intent
2. **Context Consideration**: Taking into account conversation history and player state
3. **Scenario Detection**: Using detected scenarios to narrow template selection
4. **Language Level Adaptation**: Choosing templates appropriate for the player's language level
5. **Randomization**: Introducing controlled variation to avoid repetitive responses

### Variable Substitution

The system performs variable substitution using:

1. **Entity Extraction**: Using entities extracted from the player's request
2. **Context Variables**: Drawing from conversation context and game state
3. **Dynamic Calculation**: Computing values based on game rules (e.g., ticket fares)
4. **Default Values**: Falling back to sensible defaults when specific values are unavailable

### Template Composition

Complex responses are generated through template composition:

1. **Template Chaining**: Combining multiple templates in sequence
2. **Conditional Inclusion**: Including template sections based on conditions
3. **Nested Templates**: Embedding templates within other templates
4. **Mixed-language Support**: Seamlessly handling both English and Japanese content

## Integration Points

The Template System integrates with:

1. **Tier1Processor**: Provides the primary response generation mechanism for Tier 1
2. **Intent Classifier**: Receives intent information to guide template selection
3. **Context Manager**: Accesses conversation context for contextually appropriate templates
4. **Entity Extractor**: Uses extracted entities for variable substitution
5. **Response Formatter**: Ensures final responses adhere to the companion's personality

## Testing Strategy

The Template System is thoroughly tested with:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components like the TemplateManager and TemplateEngine
2. **Template Validation Tests**: Ensuring templates are correctly formatted and valid
3. **Variable Substitution Tests**: Verifying correct substitution of variables
4. **Conditional Logic Tests**: Testing conditional sections in templates
5. **Integration Tests**: Testing the interaction with other components
6. **Linguistic Tests**: Ensuring linguistic accuracy in both English and Japanese

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Template System:

1. **Machine Learning-based Template Selection**: Using ML to select the most appropriate templates
2. **Dynamic Template Generation**: Generating templates on-the-fly based on patterns
3. **Template Analytics**: Tracking template usage and effectiveness
4. **Collaborative Editing**: Tools for non-technical team members to edit templates
5. **Adaptive Templates**: Templates that adapt based on player feedback and preferences

## Conclusion

The Template System is a core component that enables the companion AI to provide consistent, contextually appropriate responses efficiently. By using pre-defined templates with dynamic content, it ensures that players receive high-quality assistance for common requests while optimizing resource usage. The system's flexibility allows for a wide range of responses that can be tailored to the player's context, language level, and specific needs, enhancing the overall learning experience in the Tokyo Train Station Adventure game.
