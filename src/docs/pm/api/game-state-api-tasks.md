# Game State API Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the Game State API endpoints for the Tokyo Train Station Adventure game.

## Setup Phase

- [x] Create a game state router file at `backend/api/routers/game_state.py`
- [x] Set up basic router structure with appropriate imports and logging

## Model Layer

- [x] Create game state models file at `backend/api/models/game_state.py`
- [x] Define SaveGameStateRequest model with:
  - `playerId` (string)
  - `sessionId` (string)
  - `timestamp` (datetime)
  - `location` (object with area and position)
  - `questState` (object with activeQuest, questStep, objectives)
  - `inventory` (array of strings)
  - `gameFlags` (object)
  - `companions` (object)
- [x] Define SaveGameStateResponse model with:
  - `success` (boolean)
  - `saveId` (string)
  - `timestamp` (datetime)
- [x] Define LoadGameStateResponse model with:
  - `playerId` (string)
  - `saveId` (string)
  - `sessionId` (string)
  - `timestamp` (datetime)
  - `lastPlayed` (datetime)
  - `location` (object)
  - `questState` (object)
  - `inventory` (array)
  - `gameFlags` (object)
  - `companions` (object)
- [x] Define ListSavedGamesResponse model with:
  - `playerId` (string)
  - `saves` (array of save metadata)

## Adapter Layer

- [x] Create game state adapters file at `backend/api/adapters/game_state.py`
- [x] Implement SaveGameStateRequestAdapter
- [x] Implement SaveGameStateResponseAdapter
- [x] Implement LoadGameStateResponseAdapter
- [x] Update adapter factory in `backend/api/adapters/base.py` to include game state adapters

## Data Access Layer

- [x] Create game state data provider file at `backend/data/game_state.py`
- [x] Implement function to save game state
- [x] Implement function to load game state by player ID and save ID
- [x] Implement function to list saved games for a player
- [x] Create mock data for testing

## Endpoint Implementation

- [x] Implement POST `/api/game/state` endpoint for saving game state
  - [x] Add request validation
  - [x] Add error handling for invalid requests
  - [x] Add logging
  - [x] Return appropriate response with save ID
- [x] Implement GET `/api/game/state/{playerId}` endpoint for loading game state
  - [x] Add parameter validation
  - [x] Add error handling for player not found
  - [x] Add error handling for save not found
  - [x] Add logging
  - [x] Return appropriate response with game state
- [x] Implement GET `/api/game/saves/{playerId}` endpoint for listing saved games
  - [x] Add parameter validation
  - [x] Add error handling
  - [x] Add logging
  - [x] Return appropriate response with list of saves

## Testing

- [x] Create unit tests for game state request and response adapters
  - [x] Test SaveGameStateRequestAdapter
  - [x] Test SaveGameStateResponseAdapter
  - [x] Test LoadGameStateResponseAdapter
- [x] Create integration tests for game state endpoints
  - [x] Test saving game state
  - [x] Test loading game state
  - [x] Test listing saved games
  - [x] Test error cases
- [x] Create test client for manual testing

## Integration

- [x] Update main API router to include game state router
- [x] Ensure game state endpoints work with authentication
- [x] Verify integration with other components

## Documentation

- [x] Update API documentation to include game state endpoints
- [x] Add examples of request and response formats
- [x] Document error cases and handling

## Deployment

- [x] Ensure all tests pass
- [x] Update environment variables if needed
- [x] Deploy to development environment
