# System Design Documentation

This directory contains detailed design documentation for the major systems and components of the Tokyo Train Station Adventure's companion AI.

## Purpose

These documents serve several important purposes:

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture design decisions and architectural details for future reference
2. **Developer Onboarding**: Help new developers understand the system architecture quickly
3. **Maintenance Support**: Provide context for debugging and extending functionality
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Serve as a reference during implementation of related features

## Document Structure

Each system design document typically includes:

- **Overview**: A high-level description of the system and its purpose
- **Architecture**: The components that make up the system and their relationships
- **Implementation Details**: Specific details about how the system is implemented
- **Integration Points**: How the system interacts with other components
- **Testing Strategy**: Approaches for testing the system
- **Future Enhancements**: Potential improvements or extensions
