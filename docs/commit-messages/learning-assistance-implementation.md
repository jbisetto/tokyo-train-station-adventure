# Learning Assistance Module Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the Learning Assistance module for the companion AI, providing adaptive learning features to help players improve their Japanese language skills during gameplay. This completes all tasks in section 5.2 of the implementation plan.

## Details

### Added Components
- **GrammarTemplateManager**: Provides explanations for Japanese grammar points with context-relevant examples, common mistakes, and practice suggestions
- **LearningPaceAdapter**: Adjusts the learning experience based on player performance metrics and adapts difficulty accordingly
- **VocabularyTracker**: Manages vocabulary items and tracks player mastery levels
- **HintProgressionManager**: Controls the progression of hints provided to the player

### Features
- Adaptive learning pace based on player performance metrics
- Vocabulary tracking with mastery level calculation
- Grammar explanations with train station context-relevant examples
- Hint progression with multiple detail levels
- Performance tracking across multiple metrics (vocabulary mastery, grammar understanding, challenge success)
- Data persistence for all learning components using JSON storage
- JLPT N5 vocabulary and grammar points focused on train station scenarios

### Technical Implementation
- Test-driven development approach with comprehensive test coverage (31 tests)
- JSON-based data storage for learning progress and player history
- Configurable default settings for all components
- Modular design for easy extension and maintenance
- Adaptive algorithms that respond to player performance

### Documentation
- Added detailed documentation for the Learning Assistance module
- Updated AI documentation README to include the new documentation
- Updated implementation plan to mark Learning Assistance tasks as completed
