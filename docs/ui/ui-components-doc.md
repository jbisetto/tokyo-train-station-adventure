## Implementation Approach

Given your preference for domain modeling and working backwards from goals, consider this implementation strategy:

1. **Define the Language Learning Interaction Model**:
   - Create domain models for each interaction type
   - Define success/failure states for language understanding
   - Map feedback patterns to cognitive learning principles

2. **Create UI Component Prototypes**:
   - Develop paper prototypes for key interaction flows
   - Build simple digital mock-ups of core components
   - Test with language learners before full implementation

3. **Implement Tiered Development**:
   - Start with essential dialogue and feedback systems
   - Add companion interface as second priority
   - Implement progress tracking as third phase
   - Develop system interfaces as needed throughout

4. **Integration with Game Logic**:
   - Define clear interfaces between UI and domain logic
   - Establish event patterns for UI state updates
   - Create abstraction layers for AI service interactions
