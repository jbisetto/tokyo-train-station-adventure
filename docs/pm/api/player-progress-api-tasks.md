# Player Progress API Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the `/api/player/progress/{playerId}` endpoint for the Tokyo Train Station Adventure game. This endpoint retrieves the player's Japanese language learning progress, including vocabulary, grammar, and conversation metrics.

## Setup Phase

- [x] Extend FastAPI application structure to include player endpoints
- [x] Create player router in `backend/api/routers/player.py`
- [x] Register player router with main API router

## Model Layer

- [x] Define player progress request model in `backend/api/models/player_progress.py`
  - [x] Define URL parameter model for player ID
  - [x] Define validation for player ID format
- [x] Define player progress response model in `backend/api/models/player_progress.py`
  - [x] Define player information model
  - [x] Define progress metrics model
  - [x] Define vocabulary knowledge model
  - [x] Define grammar knowledge model
  - [x] Define visualization data model
  - [x] Define achievements and recommendations models

## Adapter Layer

- [x] Create player progress request adapter in `backend/api/adapters/player_progress.py`
  - [x] Implement transformation from API request to internal format
  - [x] Add validation for player ID
- [x] Create player progress response adapter in `backend/api/adapters/player_progress.py`
  - [x] Implement transformation from internal response to API format
  - [x] Format progress metrics according to API specification
- [x] Update adapter factory to include player progress adapters

## Data Access Layer

- [x] Create player progress data access module in `backend/data/player_progress.py`
  - [x] Implement function to retrieve player information
  - [x] Implement function to retrieve vocabulary progress
  - [x] Implement function to retrieve grammar progress
  - [x] Implement function to retrieve conversation metrics
  - [x] Implement function to retrieve achievements
  - [x] Implement function to generate recommendations
  - [x] Implement function to retrieve visualization data

## Endpoint Implementation

- [x] Create `/api/player/progress/{playerId}` GET endpoint
  - [x] Implement path parameter validation
  - [x] Connect endpoint to player progress data access layer
  - [x] Implement error handling for invalid player IDs
  - [x] Implement error handling for non-existent players
  - [x] Add appropriate logging

## Testing

- [x] Write unit tests for player progress request adapter
  - [x] Test validation of player ID
  - [x] Test transformation to internal format
- [x] Write unit tests for player progress response adapter
  - [x] Test transformation from internal to API format
  - [x] Test handling of null/missing fields
- [x] Write integration tests for player progress endpoint
  - [x] Test successful request flow
  - [x] Test error handling for invalid player ID
  - [x] Test error handling for non-existent player
  - [x] Test response structure and content
- [x] Create test client for manual testing
  - [x] Implement command-line test client
  - [x] Add support for different test scenarios

## Mock Implementation

- [x] Create mock player progress data for testing
  - [x] Generate realistic vocabulary data
  - [x] Generate realistic grammar data
  - [x] Generate realistic progress metrics
  - [x] Generate realistic visualization data
- [x] Implement mock data provider for development and testing

## Documentation

- [x] Update API documentation to include player progress endpoint
  - [x] Document request parameters
  - [x] Document response structure
  - [x] Document error responses
  - [x] Add examples of request and response payloads
- [x] Create usage examples for frontend developers

## Integration

- [x] Integrate with Learning Progress Tracker component
  - [x] Connect to vocabulary tracking system
  - [x] Connect to grammar tracking system
  - [x] Connect to conversation success metrics
- [x] Implement recommendation engine
  - [x] Create algorithm to identify focus areas
  - [x] Create algorithm to suggest learning activities
- [x] Implement visualization data generator
  - [x] Create skill pentagon data generator
  - [x] Create progress over time data generator
