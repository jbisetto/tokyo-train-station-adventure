# Tokyo Train Station Adventure
## AI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the proposed AI components for the Tokyo Train Station Adventure language learning game, focusing on cost-effective implementation using free tier models and Amazon Bedrock services.

## Executive Summary

The Tokyo Train Station Adventure game requires several AI components to deliver an engaging and educational Japanese language learning experience. Our implementation strategy prioritizes:

1. MVP development using local Ollama deployment with DeepSeek 7B model
2. Zero API costs during development and initial user testing phases
3. Gradual transition to hybrid model with selective use of Amazon Bedrock services
4. Tiered approach to AI usage based on complexity needs
5. Scalable architecture that can grow with user adoption

## AI Component Breakdown

### 1. Language Processing System

This system handles player's Japanese input and provides appropriate feedback.

| Component | Implementation Approach | Model Selection |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Input Recognition | Hybrid rule-based + AI approach | Bedrock Claude 3 Haiku for complex inputs |
| Error Tolerance | Pattern matching with semantic similarity | Bedrock Cohere Embed |
| Contextual Understanding | Prompt-based intent recognition | Claude models with context preservation |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Implement local MeCab tokenizer for basic Japanese processing
- Cache common responses for frequently encountered phrases
- Use pre-built JLPT N5 vocabulary validation rules locally

### 2. Companion AI (Dog Assistant)

The bilingual companion serves as both guide and teacher, requiring contextual awareness.

| Component | Implementation Approach | Model Selection |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Assistance Logic | Template-based with AI augmentation | Bedrock Claude for complex assistance |
| Teaching Behaviors | Rule-based hint progression | Local implementation + AI21 Jurassic-2 |
| Personality Engine | Templated responses with tone variation | Bedrock Meta Llama 2 |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Pre-design common hint sequences for expected learning challenges
- Implement rule-based assistance for predictable scenarios
- Reserve AI calls for novel or complex player interactions

### 3. NPC Interaction System

Creates believable Japanese-speaking NPCs with appropriate responses.

| Component | Implementation Approach | Model Selection |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Dialogue Management | Structured dialogue trees | Minimal AI usage |
| NPC Reactions | Template-based with limited variability | Claude Instant for unexpected inputs |
| Visual Feedback | Character expression generation | Stable Diffusion XL (limited usage) |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Primarily use pre-written dialogue with branching logic
- Implement fallback responses for off-script interactions
- Use model API calls only for handling truly unexpected inputs

### 4. Progress Tracking System

Monitors and adapts to player learning patterns.

| Component | Implementation Approach | Model Selection |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Language Proficiency Tracking | Local statistical analysis | No AI required |
| Mistake Pattern Recognition | Simple clustering algorithms | Local implementation |
| Adaptive Difficulty | Rule-based progression system | Periodic analysis with Meta Llama 2 |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Implement fully local tracking for common metrics
- Use batch processing for periodic learning analysis
- Reserve AI for generating personalized learning recommendations

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### MVP Architecture: Local DeepSeek 7B with Ollama

- **Zero API costs** during development and initial user testing
- **Full control** over model configuration and fine-tuning
- **Privacy preservation** as all data stays on local development machines
- **Low latency** for faster iteration during development
